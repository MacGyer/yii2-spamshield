# Arithmetic Captcha for Yii2

## Installation

The preferred way of installation is through Composer.
If you don't have Composer you can get it here: https://getcomposer.org/

You must be able to load NPM assets via Composer. This can either be achieved by the FXP composer asset plugin or by using [Asset Packagist](https://asset-packagist.org/).

To install the package add the following to the ```require``` section of your composer.json:
```
"require": {
    "macgyer/yii2-spamshield": "*"
},
```
